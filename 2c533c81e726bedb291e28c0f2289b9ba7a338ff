Debugging Process:
- Initial issue: Scheme interpreter not found (expected 'scheme', had 'guile3')
- Fixed SRFI-9 import missing for define-record-type in bst-comparison.scm
- Fixed Guile 3 incompatibility with (log x base) - changed to (log x)/(log base)
- Fixed function name mismatch: stack-top -> stack-peek in persistence benchmark
- Fixed variable name conflict in version creation (versions parameter vs local)
- Reduced dataset sizes from (1000 5000 10000) to (100 500 1000) for faster testing
- Created results directory and saved experiment outputs
- Note: Could create guile wrapper script but opted for direct fixes instead
