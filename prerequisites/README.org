* Overview

This folder contains comprehensive prerequisite guides for MIT 6.851 Advanced Data Structures. These documents help you assess your preparation level and identify areas for focused study.

** Quick Assessment

Before diving into 6.851, you should have:
- Strong foundation in algorithms and data structures (6.006 + 6.046 level)
- Mathematical maturity for proofs and analysis
- Experience with programming and implementation
- Comfort reading research papers (helpful but not required)

* Prerequisites Documentation

** [[file:mit-6046-algorithms.org][MIT 6.046 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms]]
*Essential prerequisite covering:*
- Asymptotic analysis and recurrence relations
- Fundamental data structures (BSTs, heaps, hash tables)
- Algorithm design paradigms (divide & conquer, DP, greedy)
- Graph algorithms and network flows
- Basic complexity theory and NP-completeness
- Mathematical foundations for algorithm analysis

**Assessment**: This is the minimum required background. If you struggled with 6.046 topics, spend time strengthening these fundamentals before attempting 6.851.

** [[file:mit-6854-advanced-algorithms.org][MIT 6.854 - Advanced Algorithms]]
*Recommended but not required preparation covering:*
- Advanced amortized analysis techniques
- Randomized and approximation algorithms
- Online algorithms and competitive analysis
- Linear programming and optimization
- Research paper analysis skills
- Sophisticated mathematical proof techniques

**Assessment**: Excellent preparation for 6.851 but not strictly necessary. Focus on the amortized analysis and online algorithms sections if time is limited.

** [[file:mathematical-foundations.org][Mathematical Foundations]]
*Core mathematical tools covering:*
- Discrete mathematics and proof techniques
- Probability theory and concentration inequalities
- Linear algebra and geometric concepts
- Number theory and abstract algebra basics
- Information theory and entropy
- Advanced calculus and analysis

**Assessment**: Strong mathematical background significantly eases 6.851. Focus on proof techniques, probability, and amortized analysis if starting from a weaker foundation.
