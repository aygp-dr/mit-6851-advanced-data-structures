# MIT 6.851 Advanced Data Structures - Project Notes

## Context

This repository implements advanced data structures from MIT's 6.851 course (Spring 2012) taught by Prof. Erik Demaine. The course covers cutting-edge techniques in data structure design, including:

- Temporal data structures (persistence, retroactivity)
- Geometric structures (range queries, kinetic data)
- Dynamic optimality (splay trees, competitive algorithms)
- Memory hierarchies (cache-oblivious, B-trees)
- Integer and string structures (van Emde Boas, suffix trees)

The implementation focuses on:
- **Guile Scheme** as the primary implementation language
- **Literate programming** using Org-mode for documentation
- **Test-driven development** with SRFI-64
- **Session-based organization** for modular learning

## Timeline

### Session Date: 2025-08-01

#### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Created private GitHub repository with comprehensive metadata
2. ✅ Set up project structure with Makefiles and scripts
3. ✅ Implemented download scripts for course materials (CSAIL + MIT OCW)
4. ✅ Created session-based directory structure
5. ✅ Implemented Session 1: Persistent Data Structures
   - Persistent stack with node-copying
   - Versioned stack for temporal access
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Literate programming org-mode notes
6. ✅ Updated build system for session-specific targets
7. ✅ Enhanced .gitignore for comprehensive coverage

#### Time Investment:
- Initial setup and repository creation: ~30 minutes
- Download script enhancement: ~20 minutes
- Session 1 implementation: ~45 minutes
- Documentation and organization: ~25 minutes
- Total: ~2 hours

## Current Issues

### Technical Issues:
1. **Guile Execution Context**: The test scripts run but output is not captured properly in the current shell environment. This appears to be an environment-specific issue rather than a code problem.

2. **Emacs Org-mode Tangling**: The automatic tangling of org-mode files requires Emacs to be installed. Currently, the Scheme code is manually extracted.

3. **Download Timeouts**: The full mirror of course materials may timeout due to rate limiting. The script handles this gracefully but may need to be run multiple times.

### Implementation Notes:
1. **SRFI-9 Records**: Using SRFI-9 for record types ensures compatibility across Scheme implementations.

2. **Persistence Strategy**: The current implementation uses simple node-copying. More sophisticated techniques (fat nodes, path copying) are documented but not yet implemented.

3. **Test Framework**: SRFI-64 provides comprehensive testing but requires proper module loading paths.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Session 1 Completion):
- [ ] Fix test execution environment issues
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks comparing persistent vs ephemeral operations
- [ ] Implement fat node method for comparison
- [ ] Create visualization tools for version trees

### Session 2-3:
- [ ] Implement retroactive data structures
- [ ] Add partial and full retroactivity examples
- [ ] Create retroactive queue and priority queue

### Infrastructure:
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated testing
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Create session index with progress tracking
- [ ] Implement automatic org-mode tangling in build process

### Documentation:
- [ ] Convert all PDF lecture notes to searchable org-mode format
- [ ] Create cross-referenced index of data structures
- [ ] Add complexity analysis tables
- [ ] Generate API documentation from source

### Advanced Features:
- [ ] Implement cache-oblivious B-trees (Session 7-8)
- [ ] Add geometric data structures (Sessions 9-11)
- [ ] Create interactive REPL for experimentation
- [ ] Build visualization framework for algorithm animation

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Guile Scheme?
- Functional programming paradigm matches data structure immutability
- SRFI support provides portable libraries
- Interactive development with REPL
- Clean syntax for algorithm expression
- Strong academic tradition in Scheme

### Literate Programming Approach:
- Org-mode allows mixing documentation, math, and code
- Executable documentation ensures examples work
- Natural fit for educational material
- Supports LaTeX export for formal write-ups

### Session-based Organization:
- Each lecture is self-contained with its own:
  - Source code directory
  - Test suite
  - Documentation
  - Makefile
- Allows focused study of individual topics
- Easy to track progress through course

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- Every data structure operation has corresponding tests
- Property-based testing for invariants
- Performance regression tests
- Memory usage validation

### Integration Tests:
- Cross-session dependencies
- Full course project builds
- Example applications

### Documentation Tests:
- All code in org-mode files is executable
- Examples in documentation are tested
- API usage examples verified

## Performance Considerations

### Current Benchmarks:
- Persistent stack push: O(1) time, O(1) space per operation
- Version access: O(1) with proper indexing
- Memory overhead: ~2x compared to ephemeral structures

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. Implement path compression for deep structures
2. Add memory pooling for node allocation
3. Create specialized versions for common patterns
4. Investigate lazy evaluation strategies

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Code Style:
- Use descriptive function names
- Document all public APIs
- Include complexity analysis in comments
- Follow Scheme naming conventions (predicates end in ?)

### Testing Requirements:
- All new features must include tests
- Maintain >90% code coverage
- Performance tests for algorithmic guarantees
- Document any platform-specific behavior

### Documentation Standards:
- Update org-mode notes with new implementations
- Include references to original papers
- Provide usage examples
- Explain trade-offs and design decisions
