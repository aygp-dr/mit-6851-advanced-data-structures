Context: Development environment setup for MIT 6.851 Advanced Data Structures project

Considerations:
- Added direnv support via .envrc for automatic environment variable loading
- Enhanced Emacs configuration with Scheme development tools (Geiser, Paredit)
- Created tmux-based development workflow for integrated Emacs/Guile environment
- Maintained compatibility with existing project structure and tools

Issues addressed:
- Need for consistent project root and name across tools
- Lack of integrated development environment for Scheme/Guile work
- Missing tmux session management for persistent development sessions

Technical details:
- tmux session includes 3 panes: Emacs (main), Guile REPL, shell
- Guile starts with --listen flag for Geiser integration
- Script handles session lifecycle (start/stop/attach/info)
- Makefile provides convenient targets for all operations

Timing: Implementation completed 2025-08-06
Testing: Script tested for dependency checking, session management, and TTY reporting
